## Codebase Patterns
<!--
Reusable patterns discovered during implementation.
Add new patterns here as you learn them.
Read this section FIRST on each iteration.
-->
- Use pnpm, not npm
- Run `pnpm check && pnpm typecheck` after every change
- Content source: CONTENT_SOURCE=locale for local dev (reads from ~/projects/ocobo-posts/)
- i18n: remix-i18next with useTranslation('common') + t('page.section.key')
- Routes follow ($lang) prefix pattern: _main.($lang).<page>.tsx
- Panda CSS recipes in preset/recipes/, tokens in preset/tokens/
- Legacy recipes live in preset/recipes/_legacy/ — delete dir when migration complete
- New/prototype recipes go in preset/recipes/ (standard path)
- When a legacy recipe reaches 0 usage, delete from _legacy/
- Named exports only, kebab-case filenames, no barrel files
- Navbar uses ocobo.* token namespace (ocobo.yellow, ocobo.dark, etc.) to match prototype
- Desktop vs mobile CTA: contact.cta (short) vs contact.cta.mobile (long)
- WebKit browsers need explicit hstack() pattern, not just display: flex
- Font token for headings is 'display' (Bermia), not 'heading'

# Progress Log

Project: Website Migration — Plan A (Prep + P1)
Source: specs/prd-migration-plan-a.md
Branch: migration-plan-a
Created: 2026-02-01T12:00:00Z

## Initial Setup
- Created stories.json with 16 features
- High priority: 11 features (deps, design system, flags, i18n, layout, P1 pages)
- Medium priority: 5 features (existing page adaptations, final doc sync)
- Low priority: 0 features
- Ready for implementation

---

## Feature 1: Upgrade Panda CSS v0.37 → v1.8 and Ark UI to v5.30
- Upgraded @pandacss/dev, @pandacss/preset-base, @pandacss/preset-panda, @pandacss/types from ^0.37.2 → ^1.8.1
- Ark UI already at ^5.30.0, no change needed
- Removed unused @shadow-panda/preset devDependency
- Fixed: definePreset now requires `name` property (added 'ocobo-preset')
- Fixed: carousel pattern `display: 'auto'` → `display: 'block'` (stricter types in v1)
- Kept @shadow-panda/style-context (still used by NavigationMenu.tsx)
- pnpm check ✅ pnpm typecheck ✅ codegen ✅ tests ✅ (2 pre-existing failures unrelated)

---

- Colours: updated light variants to match prototype (mint.light #EBFDF5, sky.light #F0F9FB, gray.light #F5F5F5)

- Animations: added 17 animation tokens + keyframes (float, fade, bounce, spin, marquee, entry)
- Typography: added sans/display font aliases, custom lineHeights per size, fixed 2xl fontSize (1.375rem)
- Radii: added 2xl (1rem), 3xl (1.5rem) from prototype
