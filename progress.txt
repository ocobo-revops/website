## Codebase Patterns
<!--
Reusable patterns discovered during implementation.
Add new patterns here as you learn them.
Read this section FIRST on each iteration.
-->
- Use pnpm, not npm
- Run `pnpm check && pnpm typecheck` after every change
- Content source: CONTENT_SOURCE=locale for local dev (reads from ~/projects/ocobo-posts/)
- i18n: remix-i18next with useTranslation('common') + t('page.section.key')
- Routes follow ($lang) prefix pattern: _main.($lang).<page>.tsx
- Panda CSS recipes in preset/recipes/, tokens in preset/tokens/
- Named exports only, kebab-case filenames, no barrel files
