## Codebase Patterns
<!--
Reusable patterns discovered during implementation.
Add new patterns here as you learn them.
Read this section FIRST on each iteration.
-->
- Use pnpm, not npm
- Run `pnpm check && pnpm typecheck` after every change
- Content source: CONTENT_SOURCE=locale for local dev (reads from ~/projects/ocobo-posts/)
- i18n: remix-i18next with useTranslation('common') + t('page.section.key')
- Routes follow ($lang) prefix pattern: _main.($lang).<page>.tsx
- Panda CSS recipes in preset/recipes/, tokens in preset/tokens/
- Named exports only, kebab-case filenames, no barrel files

# Progress Log

Project: Website Migration — Plan A (Prep + P1)
Source: specs/prd-migration-plan-a.md
Branch: migration-plan-a

## Initial Setup
- Created stories.json with 16 features
- High priority: 11 features (deps, design system, flags, i18n, layout, P1 pages)
- Medium priority: 5 features (existing page adaptations, final doc sync)
- Low priority: 0 features
- Ready for implementation

## Feature 1: Upgrade Panda CSS v0.37 → v1.8 and Ark UI to v5.30
- Upgraded @pandacss/dev, @pandacss/preset-base, @pandacss/preset-panda, @pandacss/types from ^0.37.2 → ^1.8.1
- Ark UI already at ^5.30.0, no change needed
- Removed unused @shadow-panda/preset devDependency
- Fixed: definePreset now requires `name` property (added 'ocobo-preset')
- Fixed: carousel pattern `display: 'auto'` → `display: 'block'` (stricter types in v1)
- Kept @shadow-panda/style-context (still used by NavigationMenu.tsx)
- pnpm check ✅ pnpm typecheck ✅ codegen ✅ tests ✅ (2 pre-existing failures unrelated)
